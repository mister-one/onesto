    "## User story\n",
    "\n",
    "#### STEP_1: The user uploads a Data_Request\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Eg.\n",
    "For example the user wants to retrive the Reviews about Product.\n",
    "In particluar the user wants to know for each review the DATE and the SCORE of the review. He also wants to know what Product is the review ABOUT and what is the CATEGORY of the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Review.score | Review.date\t| (Review)-[ABOUT]->(Product).name\t| (Review)-[ABOUT]->(Product).category |\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do so he is asked to upload a Data_Request (DR) where he specifies the:\n",
    "\n",
    "UOA (Unit-Of-Analysis): this is the item where we are going to start our reserach and should ideally be the Item of most interest in the reseacrh the user is conducting.\n",
    "\n",
    "ATTRIBUTES\n",
    "\n",
    "MEASURES\n",
    "\n",
    "LINKS \n",
    "\n",
    "of his request.\n",
    "This enables us to retrive all the nodes that have the required informations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### STEP_2: Identifying the optimal cluster we will scann\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the DR we will select the cluster that minimises the number of nodes in each cluster, given our pre-existing raking. To do so we select the NRRT (Node-Relationship-Ranking-Table) of the UOA.\n",
    "Within the NRRT we look at the ranking feature we have available and we identify the right clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Eg.\n",
    "Given that our user UOA = Review we select the NRRT for Reviews.\n",
    "In this NRRT we notice that we have only clustered reviws by DATE & [ABOUT]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### STEP_3:Retrieving the nodes that match the DR\n",
    "After we have identified the best cluster available (minimize nodes per cluster) we need to match the nodes that satisfy the DR.\n",
    "In order to do so we need to make sure that all the ATT/MEAS/LINKS requested in the DR are available.\n",
    "We first make sure that all the features of the UOA are met, and we then move on to scan the linked Items.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eg.\n",
    "\n",
    "for our UOA = Review we need to make sure that all the ATTRIBUTES and MEASURES for each Review are avialable. For the links and the ATT/MEAS/LINK of the other Item linked to the review (in our case Product) this is more complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "We scan the ABM of each node in the cluster to see if they have the required features.\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at the linked items we need to discriminated between (DIRECT_LINKS vs BEST_RATED_LINK)\n",
    "\n",
    "DIRECT_LINK:\n",
    "If you link a (Review) to a (Book) based on the ISBN with a direct link you DONâ€™T INHERIT THE ATTRIBUTES & MEASURES  of the other nodes in the cluster but you DO INHERIT the INCOMING_BEST_RATED LINKS of the cluster you are in. So if for example a DR is asking about the review (summary_score) of the books and for the book they want to know (book_title, book_publisher) if the Review is linked directly to the Book and the Book instance the Review is linked to doesn't have a Book_publisher we cannot look at the book_publisher of another instance in the cluster. However if the book_publisher is not an attribute or measure  but is insted a link then if the link (Review)-[ABOUT]-(Book)-[PUBLISHED_BY]-(Company) the second part of the link [PUBLISHED_BY]-(Company) can be taken from the Book_NRRT incoming link if there is any in the cluster where the book is in.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "BEST_RATED_LINK:\n",
    "If you link a (Review) to a (Book) based on the ISBN with a BEST_RATED link you DO INHERIT THE ATTRIBUTES & MEASURES  of the best rated nodes in the landing cluster. And as with the direct links you also INHERIT the INCOMING_BEST_RATED LINKS of the cluster you are in\n",
    "we scan the Review clustered by date and [ABOUT] to selct all the nodes that have a Review.score\n",
    "we select the nodes that have a score & a ABOUT link pointing to Product\n",
    "Then we select only the product that have a name & category\n",
    "Etsy has it Ebay & Amazon is more complex\n",
    "\"If the Ebay Review has a direct link to a product https://ebay.com/Product/123 i need to check if:\n",
    "  1. the landing node has a Product_name & category\n",
    "  2. If we also want to know the MANUFACTURER we must check if the link is not defined in the node if there is a link in the cluster the node is in or in the incoming interaction links. \"\n",
